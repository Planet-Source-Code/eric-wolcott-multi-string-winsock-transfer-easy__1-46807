MULTI STRING WINSOCK TRANSFER
------------------------------------

PURPOSE-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	To send many strings throught winsock in only 1 packet!
BEGINNING-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	First you have to create a variable that will hold your strings (DIM cSend as String).
	Next you have to add the strings to the variable 
	(cSend = text1.text & chr(0) & text2.text & chr(0) & text3.text)
	Note: chr(0) is used to mark where one string ends and where another begins.
	Afterwards send the data through winsock (Winsock1.SendData cSend).

	To receive the strings you must create a variable the hold the received data
	(rData as String). Next in the "Sub Winsock1_ReceiveData" you must put the data
	into the variable (Winsock1.GetData rData). Now you must start breaking down the code.
	To do so Dim a variable to be used for the "For Loop" (dim x as integer) and DIM as
	variable to be used in the loop (Dim strLetter as String). Aslo DIM as variable to be
	later used as a counter (Dim strCount as integer) and give it a value of "0"
	(strCount = 0) then DIM another variable as a character holder 
	(Dim ChrHolder as String). Now write the for loop (For x = 1 to len(rData)). 
	Next is to set the variable as each individual Letter in the string 
	(strLetter = mid(rdata, x, 1)). Next check to see if the selected letter is your 
	seperation character (if strLetter = chr(0) then). If it is then start your case 
	selection (select case strCount). Depending on how may strings you plan of receiveing
	may add more cases to the statement. As for now there are only going to be three. When this
	function starts the first characters in the string will not be your seperator character so
	the function will move to your else statement. What it will do is until it finds a seperator
	character it will add each individual characher to itself. When it find the seperator character
	it will go the the select case statement. Considering that you have strCount set as 0 it will
	select the case "0" and put the first string in text1.text, then it will add 1 to strCount
	so when it finds another Seperator character it will move to the next case in the satement.
	This code in return will seperate your strings into seperate textboxes or anyother object
	you choose.

EXAMPLE-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Dim rData as String
	Winsock1.GetData rData
	Dim x as Integer
	Dim strLetter as string
	Dim strCount as integer
	Dim ChrHolder as String
	for x = 1 to len(rData)
		strLetter = mid(rdata, x, 1)
		if strLetter = chr(0) then
			select case strCount
			case "0"
				Text1.Text = ChrHolder
			case "1"
				Text2.Text = ChrHolder
			case "2"
				Text3.Text = ChrHolder
			end select
			strCount = strCount + 1
			ChrHolder = ""
		else
			ChrHolder = ChrHolder & strLetter
		end if
	Next
